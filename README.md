# Footfall
Footfall analysis application using R and Shiny Dashboard for retail market and advertising recommendations along with store design and marketing strategies
The project increased sales in the retail markets by employing footfall traffic sensors to measure the footsteps of people using their smartphones. The project was written in the R programming language.
Data from footfall sensors was utilized and presented using Shiny dashboard, an R package that is used to create a web app dashboard. The web app dashboard showcased a detailed analysis on factors like the number of people who: visited, bought an item, tried something, did not buy and did not enter the retail store.
